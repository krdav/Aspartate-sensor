# Testing a GFP based aspartate biosensor

The sensor was tested by stable expression (lentivirus infection, monoclonal cell line) in different cell lines and live cell GFP/RFP signal monitoring on IncuCyte S3.
The sensor signal was captured using the GFP channel and normalized to RFP channel signal, using either RFP fused to the sensor, or a nuclear localized RFP.

Experiments were performed as either "temporal" or "steady-state".
With temporal experiments tracking Asp-sensor signal over time after a pertubation, and steady-state experiments correlating Asp-sensor signal with LCMS determined aspartate concentrations after a pertubation has reached a steady-state level of Asp-sensor signal.

Temporal data is analyzed and plotted here:

Steady-state data is analyzed and plotted here:
